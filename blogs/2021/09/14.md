# The Past
It was my best friend's birthday this past weekend, and I just had to try and one-up what she got me for my birthday.  Since what she made for me was Baby Yoda-related, I figured I would run with the same theme.  As such, I had settled on something entirely pointless, entirely cool, and entirely (seemingly) feasible.  The desired outcome was something that I had seen other people achieve already (sorry, this isn't a completely original idea) online, like by [/u/phootoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/e7uvbr/magnetic_levitation_baby_yoda_crib_ready_for_paint/) on Reddit.  Here's what I was going for: ![](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/ec/99/29/5f/3d/featured_preview_Thumbnail_corrected.png)

So, that was the idea I was working with.  I had thought it all out, and then cracked on with it.  I ordered the electronics kit and patiently waited for it to arrive since who knows when something from AliExpress is ever going to arrive (also note this was maybe my first mistake).  It arrived while I was still at uni, so I had my housemate doing electronic engineering around to help me out (thanks Ed), and I spent an evening soldering it all together, getting through the entirety of the first season of Friends.

Ok, I wholly blame my other housemate doing electronic engineering for this cock-up (sorry Darius).  How was I, an electronic engineering dropout, meant to know what a hall effect sensor is, or how they're meant to be positioned and oriented?  I soldered them down close to the circuit board, like all of the other components, and this was not the right thing to do.  I couldn't get any results when I plugged it in after all that.

Retrospectively (meaning the day before the birthday), I did also just completely leave out two vital parts of the kit, under the impression that they were just for probing with a multimeter.  I have since learned that they are integral for the thing to work.

I tried to desolder the sensors, to little avail.  One came off, which was messy, and the other two were just awful.  By this point, I had returned home and left the kit for a few weeks before getting back to it.  I ended up hammering the other sensors off of the board after taking as much of the solder off as possible.  This took the solder pads off three of the holes, and the other three were really, really messy.

## Bright idea #1
The kit comes in two circuit boards, which slot together.  The hall effect sensors are only on one of the boards, so I had the bright idea to buy a replacement kit and just swap that board out.  The product page for the first one I had bought was no longer available, so I found one with the same photos, and bought it.  I started putting it together, and noticed the circuit boards were really not the same, so I wasn't going to be able to fix it this way.  After this, I was incredibly disheartened and close to giving up on it altogether (my 3D printer was also just not working at all, but that's for another blog post).

## Bright idea #2
When I arrived at CERN, I found an electronics company in Saint-Genis (because I didn't think I'd be able to get help at CERN itself for some reason...), and called them for help.  They were ever so kind, and offered to take a look at the board to see if it was salvageable.  I went along one day during my lunch break, and they took me through to their back room to look at the terrible state of this circuit board.  Here they are working their magic!

## Bright idea #3
Since what the electronics company did had no result, and they understandably couldn't spend more time on it, I then trapsed over to a building at CERN with some engineers in, and worked my way through to their group leader.  Obviously, this was never going to happen on company time, and after a quick chat with the group leader, it was clear I wouldn't be able to get anywhere with them.

Cut to me having lunch with some colleagues later that day, and we're talking about the present.  One of them mentions that they're friends with a guy on the floor above us that does electronics, and that he could introduce me to him to see if he could help.  A glimpse of hope.  This introduction would happen the next day.

For obvious reasons (like who on earth would have any idea about how to fix a problem that even I don't understand within five minutes of looking at something that's come from AliExpress), he wasn't able to help, though he would've wanted to if he could - he was going on holiday the next day, and this was the week before the birthday, so I didn't really have much time to spare.  I was passed on to another technical student who worked with this guy, who was probably the most help out of everyone.

## And finally...
We spent some time in the lab looking at the circuit board and probing it with a multimeter, and when I finished work that day, I had a good long look for any kind of documentation for the kit, though I'd failed to find anything before.  I found, on Banggood, someone had asked a seller for instructions for the exact same kit.  Result!  It detailed how to troubleshoot and debug a few things, things that were relevant.  This was good news.  The next day, I went back to the guy upstairs, and we had another look.

We still couldn't get anywhere, but thankfully I had ordered yet another replacement kit just before I went to see the electronics company, in case they wouldn't be able to help.  I had a vague idea of where I was going wrong now, so I set to work putting the new kit (which, this time, **was** the same as the first one) together, and putting that board onto the other one from the original kit.

It worked.  It took me until 2am in the morning to get it to work, but it worked.  Turns out the hall effect sensors might actually have been fine, it was these two bits that I thought were test points that were causing all of the problems.  Serves me right, I suppose.  But anyway, it was working.  There was another problem, but it's time to go back to the start.

# Also the past but not as much the past as the first section
On the other side of the birthday present, I had to get ~~Baby Yoda~~ Grogu and his crib printed.  I would have done this myself, with my own 3D printer, but not once has that thing worked.  I looked at having this done by a local company in the UK, and they wanted more than £60 to do it.  So that wasn't an option.  And this part of the present stayed stagnant for a long while.

A few weeks ago, someone asked in a CERN group chat if anyone had a 3D printer that they could use.  Two people answered.  Of course I messaged them.  One of them pulled through, and was able to print them.  For £5.  So **WHERE** did that company get £60 from?  I doubt it, but maybe they would have done the following steps for me and saved me from further time and effort?

With filament prints, layer lines are bound to be an issue.  They were.  The guy that printed the parts told me he'd done a bit of work on it, which was very kind of him, but it wasn't much work that he'd done.  I went to the Swiss equivalent of B&Q and bought a few different sheets of sandpaper (as well as some primer paint, for later) and made a start sanding down the layer lines to make the prints nice and smooth.

This was done over multiple evenings and a Saturday afternoon, and I was glad to be done with it.  After I was satisfied with the way they were, I sprayed them with the primer paint that I'd bought, which gave them a fantastic finish and I was really impressed with what I'd done after that.  It gave me some hope that I might have it all ready in time for the birthday (I got this all finished with about a week to go, cutting it fine just a bit but not as much as the electronics).

# The Present
F**king Christ.

I flew back to the UK a few days before the birthday, and wanted to show my parents the finished product.  I plugged it in, and it didn't work.  No matter what I did, it wouldn't work.  What did I do to deserve this?  Who knows.  Maybe when I get the chance, I'll look at the electronics again some time, but this whole experience has been a turn-off for doing anything with electronics in the future.

However, I couldn't just not give my best friend this present I'd put a lot of effort into.  Or, to put it another way, I couldn't let her present for me outdo what I did for her birthday, even if the bar was set incredibly high.

I compromised.  I bought one of those little plastic stands that people put action figures on so they can pose them and stuff.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtrod/vtrod.github.io/master/content/IMG_20210912_102304_Bokeh_compressed.jpg)

This would have to do.  I glued a magnet into the magnet slots on the crib, and one onto the stand the night before the birthday using a No More Nails alternative with a rude name.  In the morning, assuming it had all set, I tested it.  It had set, but the magnets I had bought were just too strong for it.  I tried another way of holding the magnet on the stand, and it seemed to work.  I wrapped it all up just in time to get to the train station.

I'm done.  She opened it, put the crib on the stand, it held, and then the magnet fell off the stand.  Honestly, after all that, it was just adding insult to injury by having what was already a compromise fall apart even more.  I don't think my heart's sunk like that before, though this seems to be a recurring thing for me since in the past I've given myself stupid amounts of work for some of my uni coursework and because of that decision I've not once been able to submit a final, polished piece of work.  This is just another instance of that, and one that I really wish had gone better.

I know she's said it doesn't matter, that it's still super cool, and all that jazz, but it's still annoying as hell.  Maybe now I'll learn not to set myself so much work that I know I'll never pull off.

# The Future
No more electronics.  Please.

Well, maybe some day.  I'd like to get it to actually work, but I'd also like to never see a soldering iron or a multimeter ever again.

Other than that, we had the great idea of printing more Grogus out and painting them different ways - maybe I'd even try painting one.  Her first idea was using glow-in-the-dark paints, which sounds awesome and I'm looking forward to seeing that.  The same could be done with the crib, but I've learned my lesson about too much work (also the crib could get expensive if I want to print lots of them, at least Grogu's only small).


Happy Birthday 🥳
