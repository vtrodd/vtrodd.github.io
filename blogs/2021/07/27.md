# Welcome to my blog
Hopefully, this renders nicely thanks to `react-markdown` !
In an effort to one-up [stev](https://stev.top), I'm going to try and make blog posts (or vlogs, somehow...) more than once a week! Knowing me, however, that's not going to happen.

## What to expect from my blog
One of the main topics I hope to talk about in this blog is my placement year, where I will be working as a full stack developer for [CERN](https://home.cern)!  Other things might include:
* Living in Geneva (if I ever find somewhere I can afford!)
* Things I've managed to do with web development
* Other experiences I might have over the course of the next year
	* For example, going to Bahrain ðŸ‘€

## Why I'm doing this
I've never really written about stuff that I've done before, except for maybe in primary or secondary school... I'm hoping this is a good way for me to get my experiences out there, to have them written down so I can look back on things, and obviously to outdo [stev](https://stev.top) which is of utmost importance.

### That's about it!
I'm looking forward to getting the ball rolling with blogging, and hope you guys enjoy it too.  If there's anything you want me to write about, or if I make any mistakes anywhere, you can always shoot me an email at [vic@trodd.dev](mailto:vic@trodd.dev).
