# Well that was a hassle
I'm still fairly new to React, so this was a challenge for me!  However, I've managed to make it so that my SPA (Single Page App) can take in a folder full of `.md` files, which I've nicely written up on Obsidian, and give each of them their own page on my website.  The next hurdle is making it look nicer on the page, especially since currently it's mostly unstyled (and here's where I'll try and load an image within markdown)

## Revelations
After being happy with how I had solved everything, of course it didn't go to plan.  Having the `.md` files in my development folder and deploying them with `gh-pages` meant I would have to go through and do the whole `npm run deploy` shebang in order to add a new blog post.
Not to worry, I've overengineered it now.  Instead of fetching from the react app itself, I'm now fetching from my master github repo, where I've added a blogs directory to upload my blog posts to.

There might be a more elegant way to do it, but this is what I came up with.  Also note I'm not 100% sure the blogCount bit is working but that's a problem for another time, especially when there's only two blogs to load...  It also mentions loading animations but for obvious reasons I've not added these yet.

## This obviously isn't a long post
Hopefully from now on, the blogging process is significantly streamlined for me, especially if I can just upload a new `.md` file and have the site be updated.

## A final note
I'll be flying to Geneva tomorrow afternoon, and I can't wait!  I'm making a beeline for the hostel to drop off all 30kg+ of my things before doing anything else, and most likely meeting up with other CERN interns for drinks in the evening.  Who knows, I might even have done enough to warrant a proper blog post!
