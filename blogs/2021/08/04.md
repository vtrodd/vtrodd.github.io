# Foreword
Hi, I'm very aware it's been a few days since I last wrote, but I never said these would be on a regular, daily schedule, so be quiet and just read this one :)

## The calm before the storm
#### (or, the weekend before the first day of work)
I met a few of my fellow CERN interns Friday evening; we all went to one of the two (yes, **two**) pubs in the small town of Saint-Genis-Pouilly (where most of us are living).  Every single one of them that I met was lovely, and it was amazing to see how wide-reaching CERN really is.  Though, what I've noticed, and what was confirmed today by my supervisor, is that the UK is currently very over-represented; to that effect, two of the people I met both go to the University of Bristol (oh, and one of which studies electronic engineering like I did in my first year and he's also in their jazz orchestra, like I... attempted to be but gave up on), and it even turned out that we had a mutual friend!  Looking past that, however, it was refreshing to get along with them all so well.

### *Celebration Day*
On Sunday, we had Geneva's annual celebration of... the 1st of August...  I couldn't tell you why, but I'm not complaining.  The city had laid on events throughout the day, from 6am through to 11pm.  This might surprise you, but I didn't go to the 6am alpine horn concert.  I instead went later in the afternoon, and walked around to see what everything was like, and singled out one particular area that I would eventually stay at for the rest of the evening; the two events of interest there were a jazz trio and a jazz ensemble.  Both of them were great, but I have to say that the second group, the ensemble, was absolutely fantastic.

I went and spoke to the first group after they'd finished, exchanged details, and will at some point (when I've eventually brought my saxes out here) go and jam with them.  For the second group, I was sat next to two very nice middle aged women.  To begin with, one of them was struggling to understand her new SIM card, so I eventually intervened and helped out.  In this, it transpired that the two women were Brazilian, so I was able to have a good chat with them in my best Portuguese.  It also then turned out that one of them, Betty, was a musician and a great lover of jazz, who was hosting a jazz jam on Tuesday (that's now yesterday by the time I'm writing this).  So once again, I exchanged contact details, and was also able to put to them the task of helping me find somewhere to live (we'll see if they can come up with anything...).  Sadly, yesterday came around and they had to cancel the jam, to be rearranged for another day.

After an incredible concert from the second group, I went and spoke to the band and praised them all for their talent.  In conversation with their tuba player, we got on to the subject of me needing a place to live.  Whereupon, he ran over to his wife, came back, and they told me that their daughter had just moved out of their apartment, so they had a spare room that they would be happy to rent to me (for the very low price of 325CHF too!).  So what, might you ask, could go wrong?

### *A Series of Unfortunate Events*
It might not surprise you to hear that with that low price comes a whole plethora of problems.  On arrival at the apartment block, I'm told that the lift has been out of order for a while, so we take the stairs.  All six flights of them.  Next, I am welcomed in to the apartment and shown the narrow room I had been offered, which had no bed frame in but did have a thin single mattress on the floor.  Underneath all of the "carpeted" floors was a sheet of plastic, which I was told was no longer necessary but they'd left it as a precaution as a few years prior, they had lead coming up through the floors, making the entire family sick for some time.  The reason carpeted is in quotation marks is that they hadn't fitted carpets over the top of the plastic, they'd taken a selection of carpet cuttings and rugs and placed them over the top of the plastic.

I will say that the kitchen there was quite nice, and I would have been very happy using that kitchen if I somehow ended up staying there.  Moving on to the other rooms though, more issues crop up.  The son still lived there, and whilst this would have never affected me, I still found it strange that his room had no light apart from a small bedside lamp and the window had been fully blacked out.  I was shown the master bedroom too, and I noticed that the bed didn't sit against any of the walls in the room and was at a 45 degree angle.  I didn't bring it up.  Going out onto the small balcony really put into perspective quite how high up we were, and yet the street below was still incredibly loud (which is saying something with my hearing).

To top it all off, the tuba player's wife drops a bombshell that solidifies my rejection of their offer.  She pulls out her phone, says to me, "before we go any further, I just want to make sure you're okay with this", and shows me a somewhat official looking "Do Not Vaccinate" card, complete with name, photo and QR code.  She told me the whole family had them, and she tried to reassure me that her immune system was keeping her healthy without the vaccine...  Thanks for telling me after I've spent the last hour or so in close proximity to you and your husband and being shown around your apartment.  At least I didn't have to put the final nail in the coffin myself.

And so the house hunt continues...

## ðŸŽµ What a way to make a living ðŸŽµ
After all the excitement on Sunday night, and after just 5 hours sleep, it's time for my first day of work.  It was very exciting to get my CERN ID and lanyard, even if they are such minor and mundane things.  I was shown to the office I would be working in, and slowly, throughout the day, was introduced to some of the people in the building.  My supervisor had just come back from his holiday, so was in meetings for a fair few hours that day, so I was left to my own devices for a while, twiddling my thumbs and so on.  I did manage to get through some admin things, and was able to sit through the introduction Zoom meeting in complete silence since I hadn't thought to bring any headphones with me and I didn't want to disturb the rest of the office.  I don't think I missed much.

On Tuesday, I had my first experience with an electric scooter, and I'm completely sold on them.  I had to get to the other side of CERN's campus to pick up my key to the office, which would have been nearly a twenty minute walk.  Instead, using their relatively new bike/scooter sharing system, I was able to take one of CERN's electric scooters from outside my building all the way to the keys office in a matter of minutes.  For the rest of the day, I continued with some admin, and was finally introduced to the specific part of the project I would be working on.  I was told to familiarise myself with the existing progress and to make sense of the code that the team had written.

Today, I tried, and failed, to make a start.  Admitting defeat, I asked my supervisor to explain a good chunk of some of the code, and was also told that it would be changing pretty soon (pending an update from a colleague) so what he had explained would need to change.  Still, I eventually understood it and made a good start.  The nice part about having working hours is that as soon as it hits 5:30, I can put down the work and not worry about it until the next morning.

## Where I'm at now
I'm tired.  It's been a while since I've had any semblance of a normal sleep schedule, but I'll overcome that soon.  I'm getting fed up of being in this hostel because I can't bring myself to buy kitchen utensils here when everything I need is in a box back home ready to bring out here when I find somewhere to live.  Therefore, tonight's supper was spaghetti bolognese prepared in a saucepan and eaten out of a frying pan using a teaspoon.  Those are the only three things I have (technically, I have six teaspoons, but somehow I didn't think more would help me with my food).  The bed here is incredibly uncomfortable, so every morning I go into work feeling stiff, sit in a cheap office chair for 8 hours, then go back to the hostel, back to the wooden chair and paper-thin mattress.  Not sure if you can tell, but the hostel is starting to get to me.  I've just not found anywhere worth moving to yet, which isn't helping matters either.

I had some respite after work today catching up with one of my #besties ðŸ˜— which was nice, and hopefully things mellow out a bit soon as I get more and more into the swing of things.  There's talk in the CERN group chats about organising a hiking trip, but my body, in the tired state it's in right now, thinks that's the last thing I should be doing.  We'll see how I feel tomorrow, it would be nice to do more with the other CERN interns.

Thank you for reading, and good night.
